## 1. 01 Testing Overview

### Goals of Testing

- Automate the process of ensuring that our app works as we expect
- Keep us from having to manually click around the app to find bugs
- Make sure the app still works as expected even after twe change something

### Personal Thoughts

- People spend more time setting up testing than they do writing tests
- All testing frameworks / libraries are essentially the same
- You don't even have to use a testing library
