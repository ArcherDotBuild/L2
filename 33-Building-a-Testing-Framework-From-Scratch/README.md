## 1. 01 Test Framework Requirements

- Must be a Node-based CLI framework
- Must be able to test browser-based JS apps
- Must require very, very little setup
- Must be able to test a whole application, not just one little widget
- CLI must have a 'watch mode' so we don't have to keep restarting it over and over
- CLI must automatically find and run all files in our project that have a name of '*.test.js'
