The unfortunate thing about the DOM is when you're learning it, you take a look at any document or any element that you select. There are so many properties, so many methods as we've already seen a couple of times. 

It definitely can be overwhelming, but we're going to narrow it down to some of the most important methods and properties you need to know.

And these are the ones that 9 times out of 10 probably, most of the time you end up using these methods

These are the methods and properties that we use to style elements, to create new elements, to change attributes, to add a class to an element or remove a class. 

`h1.innerText` is going to give me the text that is in between the tags

`h1.textContent` same as innerText but adds spacing, text inside scripts, hidden text, gives all the text it can find
