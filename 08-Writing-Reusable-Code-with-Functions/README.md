## 08-Writing-Reusable-Code-with-Functions

## 1. Our First Function

### JS LOOPS Repeating Code

### FUNCTIONS
Reusable procedures

- Functions allow us to write reusable, modular code
- We define a "chunk" of code that we can then execute at a later point

Functions are like little machines, a bunch of code we put together and we wrap it up into a package. a machine that has a button to call it.

### 2 STEP PROCESS
- DEFINE step 1
- RUN step 2
- We use them ALL THE TIME

**Methods are functions** they're chunks of code that have been wrapped up, given a name and made into a repeatable function

`"hello".toUpperCase()`: HELLO, toUpperCase() is built in method or built in function

### DEFINE
```
function funcName() {
  // codes goes here in the body
  // do something
}
```
```
function grumpus() {
  console.log('ugh...you again...')
  console.log('for the last time...')
  console.log('LEAVE ME ALONE!!!')
}
```

### RUN
```
funcName(): // run once
funcName(): // run again!
```
