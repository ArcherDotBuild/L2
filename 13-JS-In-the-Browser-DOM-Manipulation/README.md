## 13-JS-In-the-Browser-DOM-Manipulation

## 1. Introduction to the DOM

Document Object Model

## 2. IMPORTANT NOTE HTML & CSS

Make sure you are comfortable with **basic HTML & CSS!**

You just need to understand how to create simple elements on a page, how to nest things together,
how to work with IDs and classes, how to write simple CSS selectors to select based on of elements,
classes and ID's, maybe attributes.

You need to understand how to change color to CSS and fonts and how to resize something, the basic
properties, So if you don't have that understanding right now, i recommend you take an hour or two
to go follow a tutorial online.
